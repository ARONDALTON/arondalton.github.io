# Building Science Basics For _Dummies_!

My dad always said that if you wanted to learn something new, start with a kids book and build on those new mental images.  So here is my first try to help others with building science!

## Why do this? There are so many good reasons

> Building energy use acounts for a huge amount of our energy use.
>
> ["Increasing energy efficiency in the U.S. has been much more impactful than most realize, and provides a wider [variety of benefits](https://www.iea.org/topics/energyefficiency/benefits/) beyond those typically measured or celebrated"](https://www.nexant.com/resources/benefits-energy-efficiency-go-beyond-saving-energy-and-money)
>
> ["new full-time job was created for every $57,000 spent on efficiency"](https://www.seealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/SEEA-EPS-EE-Report.pdf)
>
> Just energy eficiency standards like energy star, ["American consumers saved $63 billion on their utility bills in 2015 alone"](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/appliance-and-equipment-standards-program).  Thats amazing in my mind.
>
> ["buildings account for some 35 percent of emissions throughout the developed world"](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/david-b-goldstein/ladder-ambition-zero-net-energy-zne-buildings)
>
> ["Building materials themselves contain an amount of emissions just to get to the building"](https://mantle314.com/insights/beyond-energy-efficiency)

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

* Item foo
* Item bar
* Item baz
* Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
4. Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
